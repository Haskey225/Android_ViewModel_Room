# Android_ViewModel_Room
This is sample repository to illustrate about android ViewModel and Room Database concept with simple example code  Reference:https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view/#0

Tried Code lab instructions step by step. Alway we will get confused when we try something actively. I did it :-) So I have gone through some Medium article and blogs. Finally I got clear picture from code lab tuto.
I didn't try their sample source code. Just under stand the explanation tried what I understand from that.
